b'Given an integer array nums where  every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.\nYou must  implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use  only constant  extra space.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,2,3,2]\nOutput: 3\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]\nOutput: 99\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\nEach element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.\n\n'
