b'Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"\nOutput: true\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"\nOutput: false\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length <= 100\n0 <= t.length <= 104\ns and t consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n  \nFollow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?'
