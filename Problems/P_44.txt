b'Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for \'?\' and \'*\' where:\n\n\'?\' Matches any single character.\n\'*\' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).\n\nThe matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aa", p = "a"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aa", p = "*"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:  \'*\' matches any sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "cb", p = "?a"\nOutput: false\nExplanation:  \'?\' matches \'c\', but the second letter is \'a\', which does not match \'b\'.\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000\ns contains only lowercase English letters.\np contains only lowercase English letters, \'?\' or \'*\'.\n\n'
