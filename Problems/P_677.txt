b'A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.\nGiven a row x col  grid  of integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are there?   (Each subgrid is contiguous).\n  \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nThe following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:\n\nwhile this one is not:\n\nIn total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[8]]\nOutput: 0\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\nrow == grid.length\ncol == grid[i].length\n1 <= row, col <= 10\n0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15\n\n'
