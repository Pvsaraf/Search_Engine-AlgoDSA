b'In a string s  of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.\nFor example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and  "yy".\nA group is identified by an interval  [start, end], where  start  and  end  denote the start and end  indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example,  "xxxx"  has the interval  [3,6].\nA group is considered  large  if it has 3 or more characters.\nReturn  the intervals of every large group sorted in  increasing order by start index.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abbxxxxzzy"\nOutput: [[3,6]]\nExplanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abc"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"\nOutput: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]\nExplanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns contains lowercase English letters only.\n\n'
