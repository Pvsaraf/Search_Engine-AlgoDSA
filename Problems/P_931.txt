b"Alice and Bob continue their  games with piles of stones.   There are a number of  piles  arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones  piles[i].   The objective of the game is to end with the most  stones.  \nAlice  and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.   Initially, M = 1.\nOn each player's turn, that player  can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.   Then, we set  M = max(M, X).\nThe game continues until all the stones have been taken.\nAssuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice  can get.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation:  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]\nOutput: 104\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= piles.length <= 100\n1 <= piles[i]  <= 104\n\n"
