b"Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.\n  \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3]\nOutput: [1,2,3]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: [1]\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n  \nFollow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?\n"
