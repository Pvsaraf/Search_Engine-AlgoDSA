b'Given a non-empty  array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.\nYou must  implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use  only constant  extra space.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,2,1]\nOutput: 1\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]\nOutput: 4\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1]\nOutput: 1\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104\n-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104\nEach element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.\n\n'
