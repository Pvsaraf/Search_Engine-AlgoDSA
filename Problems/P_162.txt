b'Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.\nThe majority element is the element that appears more than    n / 2    times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,2,3]\nOutput: 3\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]\nOutput: 2\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 5 * 104\n-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n  \nFollow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?'
