b"You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:\nL0     L1             Ln - 1     Ln\n\nReorder the list to be on the following form:\nL0     Ln     L1     Ln - 1     L2     Ln - 2        \n\nYou may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.\n  \nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [1,4,2,3]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: [1,5,2,4,3]\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].\n1 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"
