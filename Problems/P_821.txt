b'Given two integers a and b, return any string s such that:\n\ns has length a + b and contains exactly a \'a\' letters, and exactly b \'b\' letters,\nThe substring \'aaa\' does not occur in s, and\nThe substring \'bbb\' does not occur in s.\n\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: a = 1, b = 2\nOutput: "abb"\nExplanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: a = 4, b = 1\nOutput: "aabaa"\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= a, b <= 100\nIt is guaranteed such an s exists for the given a and b.\n\n'
