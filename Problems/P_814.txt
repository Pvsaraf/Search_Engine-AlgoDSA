b'Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]\nOutput: [0,1,9,16,100]\nExplanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].\nAfter sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]\nOutput: [4,9,9,49,121]\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 104\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\nnums is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n  \nFollow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?'
