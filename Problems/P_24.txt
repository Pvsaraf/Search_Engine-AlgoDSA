b"Given a  linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without  modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)\n  \nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [2,1,4,3]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: head = []\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: head = [1]\nOutput: [1]\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the  list  is in the range [0, 100].\n0 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n"
